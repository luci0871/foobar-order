                <h2>ELECTRIC ARC LAMP</h2>
                <p> <h5>by Humphry Davy</h5>
                    Humphry Davy invented the first electric lightbulb in 1802. He experienced with electricity and invented an electric battery. 
                    When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. 
                    While it produced light, it didn’t last long and was too bright for practical purposes. It is known as the electric arc lamp. </p>

                <h2>EARLY LIGHTBULBS</h2>
                <p> <h5>by Warren de la Rue and Joseph Wilson Swan</h5>
                <b>Warren de la Rue</b>, a British scientist, invented one of the world’s first electric lightbulbs. 
                He placed within a vacuum tube a platinum coil and glided an electric current through it. 
                The design was done so that the high melting point of platinum would help it operate at higher temperatures 
                and that the released chamber would have less gas molecules to respond with the platinum, making it last longer. 
                Although an efficient design, the cost of platinum made it impractical for commercial production. <br>

                <h2>THE INCANDESCENT LIGHTBULB</h2>
                <p> <h5>by Thomas Alva Edison </h5> 
                Thomas Edison is credited with the invention of the lightbulb, because his version outstripped earlier versions; it was both practical and inexpensive. 
                Thomas Edison and his team tested more than 3,000 designs of lightbulbs between 1878 and 1880. 
                Thomas Edison filed his first light bulb patent in 1879 with a carbon filament. Him and his team tested 6,000 different plants to find out which one would burn the longest; it was carbonized bamboo.
                His discovery marks the beginning of commercially produced light bulbs in the 1880s.  </p>

                <h2>TUNGSTEN FILAMENTS</h2>
                <p><h5>General Electric</h5> 
                The company was the first to patent a method of making tungsten filaments for use in incandescent lightbulbs in 1906. 
                Edison knew that tungsten was an excellent material for light bulb filaments, but the machinery needed to produce super-fine tungsten wire was not available in the late 19th century. 
                Tungsten filaments is still the most widely used filament in incandescent light bulbs today. </p>

                <h2>THE FUTURE OF LIGHTBULBS</h2>
                <p> Modern incandescent light bulbs are not efficient; less than 10% of the electrical power supplied to the bulb is converted into visible light.
                    The remaining energy is lost as heat, but they are still widely used due to advantages such as: <br>
                    <br> <small>
                    1. Wide, low-cost availability <br>
                    2. Easy incorporation into electrical systems <br>
                    3. Adaptable for small systems <br>
                    4. Low voltage operation, such as in battery powered devices <br>
                    5. Wide shape and size availability <br>
                    <br> </small>

                    Many countries are, however, phasing out the modern incandescent bulbs for LED lights as prices for LED light falling significantly.  </p>
